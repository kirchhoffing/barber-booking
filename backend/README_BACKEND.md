# Backend Service - Barber Booking System

The backend service for the Barber Booking System, built with Express.js and TypeScript.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Core Components
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Implement business logic
- **Middleware**: Process requests before reaching controllers
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints
- **Models**: Define data structures and database schema
- **Utils**: Shared utility functions

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Customer, Barber, and Admin accounts
- **Appointments**: Booking records
- **Services**: Barber services and pricing
- **Working Hours**: Barber availability
- **Reviews**: Customer feedback

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation with Zod

### User Roles
- **Customer**: Can book appointments and manage their profile
- **Barber**: Can manage services, working hours, and appointments
- **Admin**: Full system access and management capabilities

## 📊 API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
- **Auth Routes**: User authentication and authorization
- **User Routes**: User profile management
- **Appointment Routes**: Booking and management
- **Service Routes**: Service listing and management
- **Working Hours Routes**: Availability management
- **Admin Routes**: System administration

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "statusCode": 200
}
```
